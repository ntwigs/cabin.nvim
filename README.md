## The whys and whats ✨

I've relapsed into the dark and dangerous world of unix ricing. And of course, everything needs to be match matchy and looking good. Therefore I'm taking my nvim theme *Cabin* and throwing that magnificent creation onto the world.

## Palette please 💅

Here you go. Hand picked and superior to all other color palettes. Except maybe [Magoon](https://github.com/ntwigs/magoon), since that theme is just.. wow! But Cabin is at least a good old 8/10. 😬
